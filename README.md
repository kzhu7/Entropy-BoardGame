# Entropy-BoardGame

"Entropy is a board game by Augustine Carreno published in 1994. It is played on a square board divided into 5Ã—5 cells, with seven black and seven white pieces set up as in the Korean board game Five Field Kono. The object is to be first to go from the initial position, in which all the player's pieces can move, to a position in which none can. A piece is able to move only when it is in contact, orthogonally or diagonally, with at least one other piece of the same type."
